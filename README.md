# Optimizing Multi-Size Facility Location under Competition

This repository contains the code and data for the paper "Optimizing Multi-Size Facility Location under Competition: A Model with Competitive Decay and Enhanced Genetic Algorithms."

## Overview

This study addresses the multi-size bank location problem by incorporating competitive factors into the optimization process. The model includes competitive decay to simulate real-world conditions and uses an enhanced genetic algorithm to identify optimal facility locations and scales.
